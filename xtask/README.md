# xtask

Internal task runner for repository maintenance tasks.

This is for maintainers working inside this repository. Application users
should use the published `koruma` crates and public book instead of invoking
`xtask` directly.

## Commands

### `sync-display-ftl`

Synchronizes English Fluent messages with `std::fmt::Display` implementations
in `koruma-collection` validators.

```bash
cargo xtask sync-display-ftl
```

### `build book`

Builds the mdBook into `web/public/book`.

```bash
cargo xtask build book
```

### `build llms-txt`

Builds `web/public/llms.txt`, `web/public/llms-full.txt`, and per-chapter
Markdown files under `web/public/llms/` from the current mdBook sources.

```bash
cargo xtask build llms-txt
```

### `build web`

Builds the release SSG Dioxus site for GitHub Pages into `web/dist`.

```bash
cargo xtask build web
```

### `release plan`

Prints the crates.io publish order for publishable workspace crates. The order
is computed from non-dev workspace dependencies so dependent crates are not
packaged before their registry dependencies exist.

```bash
cargo xtask release plan
```

### `release publish`

Prints the publish commands in release order. By default, this uses
`cargo hack --no-dev-deps publish` because versioned dev-dependencies are
validated during packaging and workspaces can have dev-dependency
back-references between crates. Add `--execute` to upload. Use
`--from <package>` to resume after a failure or crates.io index delay.

```bash
cargo xtask release publish
cargo xtask release publish --execute --skip-existing
```

The cargo-hack path passes `--allow-dirty` through to `cargo publish` because
cargo-hack temporarily rewrites package manifests while removing
dev-dependencies. To avoid publishing unrelated edits, xtask still requires a
clean tracked worktree before each publish attempt unless you pass xtask's own
`--allow-dirty` flag.

This command requires `cargo-hack` unless you pass `--include-dev-deps`.
